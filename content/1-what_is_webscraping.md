Web scraping is the process of extracting content from webpages (e.g. text, images, audio/video files). In research, a common objective is to generate datasets suitable for analysis. 
Web scraping can be done *manually* by copy-pasting webpage content into a file. However, the term often refers to *automated* web scraping which can include methods such as web crawling, machine learning or programming techniques, use of web scraping software, or even of a web scraping service. 

> "Data displayed by websites can only be viewed using a web browser. Most websites do not allow you to save a copy of this data 
to a storage location or database. If you need the data, the only option is to manually copy and paste the data
\- a very tedious job which can take many hours or days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process,
so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same 
task within a fraction of the time"

Note that web scraping is different from web crawling: Web scraping is the *extraction* of specific data points, whereas web crawling is the *indexing* of whole websites using bots (a.k.a. crawlers, spiders), such as when a search engine indexes a massive amount of web content in order to retrieve information that match a searcher's keywords.

Web scraping software will automatically load, crawl and extract data from multiple pages or websites based on your requirements. It is either custom built for a specific website or configured to work with any website.

Web scraping software can be categorised into two types of applications:

1. Cloud-based applications or browser applications installed locally on your computer for scraping data from individual web pages

2. Coded solutions that use Python and R packages to automate the process of scraping data from multiple web pages  
  
In this workshop we will look at packages such as Beautifulsoup, Selesium and Scrapy.
